# Project Title: Performance Testing of COVID-19 Global Statistics API

## Project Summary : 
This project focuses on performance testing of the COVID-19 Global Statistics API from disease.sh (Server:https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all) through load and stress testing. The tests simulate 120,000 users over 12 hours and identify the system's bottleneck point and capacity TPS through stress test .The objective is to evaluate the API's response time, stability, and reliability under various load conditions. The tests are designed to simulate multiple scenarios, such as high traffic and sustained usage, to ensure the API can handle real-world demands.

## Prerequisites
- Java (Latest version)
- Apache JMeter (Latest version)

## How to Run Performance Tests?
###Execute the following commands:
- ```Run the jmeter.bat (Windows) or jmeter.sh (Unix) script from the bin directory. ```
- ```Open JMeter GUI and load the provided test plan file (covid19_test_plan.jmx).```
- ```Open JMeter GUI and load the provided test plan file (covid19_test_plan.jmx).```
- ```Click the green Start button in JMeter to begin the test.``` 
- ```View results using the added listeners (e.g., View Results Tree, Summary Report).```
